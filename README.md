# Forecast Engine

**Status:** Under Construction ðŸš§

Our vision for the Forecast Engine is an easy-to-use tool for generating demand forecasts from user-provided data. The goal is to provide a simple interface for uploading your data and receiving accurate demand predictions, making it accessible for users without deep statistical or programming knowledge.

This project will start with basic features and gradually expand to include more advanced functionality and customization options.

## Current features
